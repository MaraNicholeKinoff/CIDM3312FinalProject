# Final Project

#Buffteks Project Management Web Application

# We are completing a website to manage Buffteks projects, students, and clients.

# You will use ASP.NET MVC Core 2.0 to build a web application subject to the following requirements:

    # Using Entity Framework,  you will maintain a SQLite database for the following entities:
        # Member - A member of the Buffteks
        # Client - A client who provides a project to the Buffteks members
        # Project - A project for Members and Clients to collaborate on
    # Using Scaffolding, create Controllers and Views to manage the Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for each of the entities above
    # Data seeding:
        # Create at least two projects
        # Create at least two clients
        # Create at least ten Members
    # Assignment Members and Clients to Projects
    # Be able to search/filter for Clients or Members by Project (this can't be scaffolded)
    # Use Layouts and Views and Bootstrap 4 to create a unique visual appearance and style for your app
